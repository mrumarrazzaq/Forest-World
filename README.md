## Story of game

Game is a history-based game like game shows past stone age experiences where a person lives, having a simple body covering clothes. He passed from a horrible forest to survive and use his brain to solve the hurdles (like deadly insects, snakes, spiders, spikes, a flowing river, bats, a horrible and dark cave, stones).
It is quite an interesting and mind-refreshing game. Games provide an experience of the past.
